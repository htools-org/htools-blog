In this tutorial we will need just the RPi and a SD Card (min 4GB). We also need a SD Card reader (USB or native).
Raspberry Pi OS First step is to install the OS in the SD card. Raspberry Pi has a utility called Raspberry Pi Imager that does all the work for us.</description></item><item><title>HNS + PowerDNS + Nginx + DANE - Introduction</title><link>https://blog.htools.work/posts/hns-pdns-nginx/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://blog.htools.work/posts/hns-pdns-nginx/</guid><description>Posts in this series:
Introduction (this one!) Part 1 - Set up DNS server Part 2 - Set up Web server Part 3 - Secure with DANE So you wanna build a snowman website on a Handshake domain.
Any website (even a regular one on an ICANN domain) needs 3 things to function
A domain name - hope you have one ready A DNS server - this is what tells browsers where to fetch content from A web server - someplace where content is stored or served from Let&amp;rsquo;s quickly go through what they are (feel free to skip if you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with DNS basics).</description></item><item><title>HNS + PowerDNS + Nginx + DANE - Part 1</title><link>https://blog.htools.work/posts/hns-pdns-nginx-part-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://blog.htools.work/posts/hns-pdns-nginx-part-1/</guid><description>Posts in this series:
Introduction Part 1 - Set up DNS server (this one!) Part 2 - Set up Web server Part 3 - Secure with DANE Set up DNS server We&amp;rsquo;ll be using PowerDNS here. You can use bind9, knot, or any other authoritative server, but PowerDNS is the (personally) easiest to set up and use.
Sebastian Rasor has a similar guide with nsd: https://www.sebastianrasor.com/blog/hosting-a-secure-website-on-the-handshake-protocol-using-dane
Disable Stub Resolver First things first, Ubuntu comes with systemd&amp;rsquo;s stub resolver listening on port 53, which we&amp;rsquo;ll need to stop / free up.</description></item><item><title>HNS + PowerDNS + Nginx + DANE - Part 2</title><link>https://blog.htools.work/posts/hns-pdns-nginx-part-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://blog.htools.work/posts/hns-pdns-nginx-part-2/</guid><description>Posts in this series:
Introduction Part 1 - Set up DNS server Part 2 - Set up Web server (this one!) Part 3 - Secure with DANE Set up Web Server In this part, we&amp;rsquo;ll set up a simple nginx server that just serves a static website. You can also go with any other software like Apache httpd or lighttpd.
Install nginx # Install nginx sudo apt install nginx -y # create a directory to place website sudo mkdir -p /var/www/smartface Add content Copy your website files into /var/www/smartface.</description></item><item><title>HNS + PowerDNS + Nginx + DANE - Part 3</title><link>https://blog.htools.work/posts/hns-pdns-nginx-part-3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://blog.htools.work/posts/hns-pdns-nginx-part-3/</guid><description>Posts in this series:
Introduction Part 1 - Set up DNS server Part 2 - Set up Web server Part 3 - Secure with DANE (this one!) Secure with DANE If you&amp;rsquo;re following with the series, we have a website reachable with a Handshake domain, but it&amp;rsquo;s only over HTTP and not secure.
With regular domains, one would request a Certificate Authority (CA) to sign our certificate and then use it on the web server.</description></item></channel></rss>
